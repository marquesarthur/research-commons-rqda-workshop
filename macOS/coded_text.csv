"1",8,"G20-2010-obama"," I want to briefly comment on the agreement in Iraq that's taken place on the framework for a new government.
There’s still challenges to overcome, but all indications are that the government will be representative, inclusive, and reflect the will of the Iraqi people who cast their ballots in the last election."
"2",11,"G20-2010-obama"," Iraqis are showing their determination to unify Iraq and build its future and that those impulses are far stronger than those who want Iraq to descend into sectarian war and terror."
"3",14,"G20-2010-obama","For the last several months, the United States has worked closely with our Iraqi partners to promote a broad-based government -- one whose leaders share a commitment to serving all Iraqis as equal citizens."
"4",16,"G20-2010-obama","We worked together to pull the global economy back from catastrophe.
To avoid the old cycles of boom and bust that led to that crisis, we committed ourselves to growth that is balanced and sustained, including financial reform and fiscal responsibility."
"5",16,"G20-2010-obama","The actions we took were not always easy or popular.
But they were necessary.
As a result, the global economy is growing again.
Some economies, especially emerging economies, are experiencing strong economic growth."
"6",2,"G20-2010-obama","Jobs are being created, as in the United States, where we’ve had 10 consecutive months of private sector job growth and created more than one million private sector jobs this year alone."
"7",2,"G20-2010-obama","In short, we succeeded in putting the global economy back on the path of recovery -- but we also know that the progress has not come nearly fast enough, especially when it comes to my highest priority, which is putting Americans back to work."

"9",8,"G20-2010-obama","So here in Seoul, the question was whether our nations could work together to keep the global economy growing."
"10",16,"G20-2010-obama","And for the first time, we spelled out the actions that are required -- in four key areas -- to achieve the sustained and balanced growth that we need."
"11",9,"G20-2010-obama","At home, the United States has been doing our part by making historic investments in infrastructure and education, research and clean energy."
"12",17,"G20-2010-obama","At home, the United States has been doing our part by making historic investments in infrastructure and education, research and clean energy."
"13",16,"G20-2010-obama","And as a consequence, our economy is growing again -– even as we must do more to ensure that that growth is sustained and translates into jobs for our people."
"14",8,"G20-2010-obama","Here at Seoul, we agreed that growth must be balanced.
Countries with large deficits must work to reduce them, as we are doing in the United States, where we’re on track to cut our deficit in half by 2013, and where I’m prepared to make tough decisions to achieve that goal.
Likewise, countries with large surpluses must shift away from unhealthy dependence on exports and take steps to boost domestic demand.
As I’ve said, going forward, no nation should assume that their path to prosperity is paved simply with exports to the United States.
"
"15",16,"G20-2010-obama","Third, we took further steps to implement financial regulatory reform."
"16",16,"G20-2010-obama","Second, we agreed that exchange rates must reflect economic realities."
"17",2,"G20-2010-obama","The work we did here today builds on a new development policy that I announced in September and recognizes that the most effective means of lifting people out of poverty is to create sustainable economic growth -– growth that will create the markets of the future."

"19",8,"G20-2010-obama","That’s why, for example, we will continue to work towards a U.S.-Korea free trade agreement in the coming weeks -- not just any agreement, but the best agreement to create jobs both in America and Korea."
"20",16,"G20-2011-obama","Over the past two years, those of us in the G20 have worked together to rescue the global economy, to avert another depression, and to put us on the path to recovery."
"21",9,"G20-2011-obama","And since our last meeting in Seoul we’ve experienced a number of new shocks -- disruptions in oil supplies, the tragic tsunami in Japan, and the financial crisis in Europe."
"22",5,"G20-2011-obama","And since our last meeting in Seoul we’ve experienced a number of new shocks -- disruptions in oil supplies, the tragic tsunami in Japan, and the financial crisis in Europe."

"24",2,"G20-2011-obama","Around the world, hundreds of millions of people are unemployed, or underemployed."
"25",8,"G20-2011-obama","So the central question coming into Cannes was this:  Could the world’s largest economies confront this challenge squarely -- understanding that these problems will not be solved overnight, could we make progress?"
"26",16,"G20-2011-obama","That’s how we confronted our financial crisis in the United States -- having our banks submit to stress tests that were rigorous, increasing capital buffers, and passing the strongest financial reforms since the Great Depression."
"27",8,"G20-2011-obama","Europe remains on track to implement a sustainable path for Greece.
Italy has agreed to a monitoring program with the IMF -- in fact, invited it.
Tools have been identified that will better enable the world to support European action.
And European finance ministers will carry this work forward next week."
"28",2,"G20-2011-obama","we agreed to stay focused on jobs and growth with an action plan in which each nation does its part."
"29",8,"G20-2011-obama","In an important step forward, countries with large surpluses and export-oriented countries agreed to take additional steps to support growth and boost demand in their own countries. In addition, we welcome China's determination to increase the flexibility of the RMB."
"30",16,"G20-2011-obama","Following our reforms in the United States, the G20 adopted an unprecedented set of high-level financial reforms to prevent a crisis in the future."
"31",15,"G20-2011-obama","And even as our countries work to save lives from the drought and terrible famine in the Horn of Africa, we agreed on the need to mobilize new resources to support the development that lifts nations out of poverty."
"32",16,"G20-2012-obama","Mexico is the first Latin American country to host a G20 summit, and this has been another example of Mexico playing a larger role in world affairs, from the global economy to climate change to development."
"33",3,"G20-2012-obama","Mexico is the first Latin American country to host a G20 summit, and this has been another example of Mexico playing a larger role in world affairs, from the global economy to climate change to development."
"34",16,"G20-2012-obama","Now, over the past three years, these G20 summits have allowed our nations to pull the global economy back from a free fall and put us back on the path of recovery and growth."
"35",2,"G20-2012-obama","In the United States, our businesses have created jobs for 27 months in a row -- more than 4 million jobs in all -- and our highest priority continues to be putting people back to work even faster."
"36",2,"G20-2012-obama","As our largest trading partner, slower growth in Europe means slower growth in American jobs."
"37",8,"G20-2012-obama","So we have a profound interest in seeing Europe prosper."
"38",8,"G20-2012-obama","Since this is my last visit to Mexico during President Calderon’s time in office, I want to say how much I’ve valued Felipe’s friendship and the progress that we’ve made together over the past several years."
"39",14,"G20-2012-obama","So this has been an opportunity for us to hear from European leaders on the progress they’re making and on their next steps -- especially in the wake of the election in Greece, and because they’re heading into the EU summit later this month."
"40",16,"G20-2012-obama","Over the last two days European leaders here in Cabos have made it clear that they understand the stakes and they pledged to take the actions needed to address this crisis and restore confidence, stability, and growth."
"41",16,"G20-2012-obama","I welcome the important steps that they have already taken to promote growth, financial stability and fiscal responsibility."
"42",16,"G20-2012-obama","Another positive step forward was the eurozone’s commitment to work on a more integrated financial architecture -- including banking supervision, resolution, and recapitalization, as well as deposit insurance."
"43",2,"G20-2012-obama","As the world’s largest economy, the best thing the United States can do is to create jobs and growth in the short term, even as we continue to put our fiscal house in order over the long term."
"44",8,"G20-2012-obama","Here in Los Cabos, we announced important steps towards closer integration with three of our major trading partners.
Both Mexico and Canada have been invited to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, which is an ambitious 21st century trade agreement that will now include 11 countries.
And this agreement holds enormous opportunities to boost trade in one of the world’s fastest growing regions. "

"46",8,"G20-2012-obama","So today, the United States and the European Union agreed to take the next step in our work towards the possible launching of negotiations on an agreement to strengthen our already very deep trade and investment partnership."
"47",14,"G20-2012-obama","I’d note that with Mexico’s leadership, we continue to make progress across a range of challenges that are vital to our shared prosperity -- from food security to Greek economic growth that combats climate change, from financial education and protection for consumers to combating corruption that stifles economic growth, and in strengthening financial regulation to creating a more level playing field."

"50",16,"G20-2013-obama","This summit marks another milestone in the world’s recovery from the financial crisis that erupted five years ago this month."
"51",9,"G20-2013-obama","Our manufacturing sector is rebounding."
"52",5,"G20-2013-obama","We’re reducing our addiction to foreign oil and producing more clean energy."
"53",9,"G20-2013-obama","We’re reducing our addiction to foreign oil and producing more clean energy."
"54",2,"G20-2013-obama","And as we learned today, over the past three and a half years, our businesses have created seven and a half million new jobs -- a pace of more than 2 million jobs each year."
"55",18,"G20-2013-obama","We’re also making progress in putting our fiscal house in order."
"56",2,"G20-2013-obama","And as Congress takes up important decisions in the coming months, I’m going to keep making the case for the smart investments and fiscal responsibility that keep our economy growing, creates jobs and keeps the U.S. competitive."

"62",8,"G20-2013-obama","During my trip, we also continued our efforts to advance two key trade initiatives:  the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the Trans-Pacific Partnership."
"63",4,"G20-2013-obama","Of course, even as we’ve focused on our shared prosperity, and although the primary task of the G20 is to focus on our joint efforts to boost the global economy, we did also discuss a grave threat to our shared security and that’s the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons."
"64",4,"G20-2013-obama","And what I’ve been emphasizing and will continue to stress is that the Assad regime’s brazen use of chemical weapons isn’t just a Syrian tragedy.
It’s a threat to global peace and security."
"65",4,"G20-2013-obama","Syria’s escalating use of chemical weapons threatens its neighbors -- Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Israel."
"66",4,"G20-2013-obama","It increases the risk that these weapons will fall into the hands of terrorist groups"
"67",11,"G20-2013-obama","It increases the risk that these weapons will fall into the hands of terrorist groups"
"68",15,"G20-2013-obama"," But, more broadly, it threatens to unravel the international norm against chemical weapons embraced by 189 nations, and those nations represent 98 percent of the world’s people. "

"70",4,"G20-2013-obama","Failing to respond to this breach of this international norm would send a signal to rogue nations, authoritarian regimes, and terrorist organizations that they can develop and use weapons of mass destruction and not pay a consequence.
And that’s not the world that we want to live in."
"71",11,"G20-2013-obama","Failing to respond to this breach of this international norm would send a signal to rogue nations, authoritarian regimes, and terrorist organizations that they can develop and use weapons of mass destruction and not pay a consequence.
And that’s not the world that we want to live in."
"72",8,"G20-2013-obama","This is why nations around the world have condemned Syria for this attack and called for action."
"73",4,"G20-2013-obama","I’ve been encouraged by discussions with my fellow leaders this week; there is a growing recognition that the world cannot stand idly by.
Here in St. Petersburg, leaders from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East have come together to say that the international norm against the use of chemical weapons must be upheld, and that the Assad regime used these weapons on its own people, and that, as a consequence, there needs to be a strong response. "
"74",8,"G20-2013-obama","So, in the coming days, I’ll continue to consult with my fellow leaders around the world, and I will continue to consult with Congress.
And I will make the best case that I can to the American people, as well as to the international community, for taking necessary and appropriate action."
"75",16,"G20-2014-obama","This is the final day of a trip that has taken me across the Asia Pacific -- a visit that comes against the backdrop of America’s renewed economic strength."
"76",2,"G20-2014-obama","The United States is in the longest stretch of uninterrupted private sector job growth in its history."
"77",2,"G20-2014-obama","Over the last few years, we’ve put more people back to work than all the other advanced economies combined."
"78",16,"G20-2014-obama","And this growing economic strength at home set the stage for the progress that we have made on this trip."
"79",8,"G20-2014-obama","We continue to make progress toward the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Our agreement with China to extend visas for business people, tourists and students is going to boost tourism, grow our two economies and create jobs for Americans and Chinese alike."
"80",8,"G20-2014-obama","We also agreed with China to pursue a bilateral investment treaty, as well as agreeing on an approach to the Information Technology Agreement that is estimated would support some 60,000 American jobs."

"85",16,"G20-2014-obama","These were not just goals that were set without any substance behind them.
We have made very concrete progress during the course of the last several G20 sessions in preventing companies from avoiding the taxes that they owe in their home countries, including the United States, and making sure that we’ve got a financial system that’s more stable and that can allow a bank to fail without taxpayers having to bail them out."
"86",8,"G20-2014-obama","Meanwhile, the breakthrough the United States achieved with India this week allows for a resumption of talks on a global trade deal that would mean more growth and prosperity for all of us."
"87",3,"G20-2014-obama","This week, we also took historic steps in the fight against climate change."
"88",2,"G20-2014-obama","The ambitious new goal that I announced in Beijing will double the pace at which America reduces its carbon pollution while growing our economy and creating jobs, strengthening our energy security, and putting us on the path to a low carbon future."

"91",3,"G20-2014-obama","Combined with China’s commitment -- China for the first time committed to slowing and then peaking and then reversing the course of its emissions -- we’re showing that there’s no excuse for other nations to come together, both developed and developing, to achieve a strong global climate agreement next year."

"94",10,"G20-2014-obama","
And finally, I’m pleased that more nations are stepping up and joining the United States in the effort to end the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.
Coming on the heels of our Global Health Security Agenda in the United States, the G20 countries committed to helping nations like those in West Africa to build their capacity to prevent, detect and respond to future outbreaks before they become epidemics.

"98",5,"greta-thunberg-un-climate-change-conference-speech-transcript","In chapter two, on page 108 in the SR 1.5 IPCC report that came out last year, it says that if we ought to have a 6% to 7% chance of limiting the global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, we had on January 1, 2018, 420 gigatons of CO2 left two emit in that budget.
And of course that number is much lower today as we emit about 42 gigatons of CO2 every year including land use."
"99",3,"greta-thunberg-un-climate-change-conference-speech-transcript","That means that richer countries need to do their fair share and get down to real zero emissions much faster and then help poorer countries do the same, so people in less fortunate parts of the world can raise their living standards.
These numbers also don’t include most feedback loops, nonlinear tipping points, or additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution."

"101",3,"greta-thunberg-un-climate-change-conference-speech-transcript","Why is it so important to stay below 1.5 degrees? Because even at one degree people are dying from the climate crisis.
Because that is what the United Science calls for to avoid destabilizing the climates.
So that we have the best possible chance to avoid setting off irreversible chain reactions such as melting glaciers, polar ice and thawing Arctic permafrost.
Every fraction of a degree matters.
So there it is, again.

This is what I want you to focus on."

I also note that the strikes took place in areas no longer under the effective control of that Government.

I think it is undeniable – and the subject of broad international consensus – that these extremist groups pose an immediate threat to international peace and security.

Today a coalition of more than 200 mayors, representing 400 million people, will sign a Mayor’s Compact to reduce annual emissions by between 12.4 and 16.4 per cent.

Announcements on agriculture and forests will highlight a commitment by many of the world’s largest and most well-known companies to adapt their supply chains to reduce emissions and build resilience to climate change.
"
"124",16,"G20-2014","Some of the largest financial institutions, investors, banks and insurance companies will announce that they will shift more than 200 billion dollars toward building low-carbon economies by 2015."

"126",11,"G20-2015","Let me start by reiterating my profound condolences to the people of France following the barbaric terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday night.
My thoughts are with the families of the victims at this time of grief and loss."
"127",11,"G20-2015","Terrorists continue to commit atrocious acts across the world.
Their inhumanity is clear; their ideologies are bankrupt.
No grievance or cause can justify such violence.
Those who claim to be acting in the name of religion are only harming their religion."
"128",11,"G20-2015","Terrorism is a threat to all humankind.
As we have seen over the years with grim regularity, no country, and no city, nobody is immune.
In the past four days alone, horrendous terrorist bombings have also killed dozens of people in Beirut and Baghdad.
"
"129",11,"G20-2015","I will stress to world leaders that our response needs to be robust, but always within the rule of law and with respect for human rights.

These goals can set the direction for a prosperous, inclusive and environmentally sustainable world.
They should be a priority at this Summit."
"132",3,"G20-2015","Governments will soon meet in Paris to finalize a global climate change agreement.
One hundred and sixty-one countries representing more than 90 per cent of global emissions have now submitted their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions or INDC.
These plans will bend the emissions curve downward, and move us in the right direction.
"
"133",8,"G20-2015","Paris must send a clear signal to markets that the low-carbon transformation of the global economy is inevitable and beneficial.
"
"134",16,"G20-2015","The agreement must be able to accommodate changes in the global economy while striking balance between the leadership role of developed countries and the increasing responsibilities of developing countries."
"135",16,"G20-2015","An agreement must provide financing and technology transfer for developing countries.
Developed countries must keep their pledge to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 for both adaptation and mitigation.
"
"136",14,"G20-2015","An agreement must establish strong monitoring mechanisms, be able to respond to rapidly escalating climate impacts, and ensure that we are on a path to a low carbon economy, as science demands."
"137",12,"G20-2015","We must ensure enhanced support to these and other countries accommodating the greatest numbers of refugees -- without at the same time cutting back on official development assistance."

I pay tribute to Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon for hosting 4 million Syrian refugees.

"139",4,"G20-2015","Secretary of State Kerry, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and others involved in the talks yesterday in Vienna.
I urge the participants to move beyond their differences so that they can push further for a nationwide ceasefire, combat terrorism and address key governance and constitutional issues.
After years of division, this is a rare moment of diplomatic opportunity to end the violence and advance the search for a negotiated political solution."

"143",5,"G20-2016","With China and the United States making this historic step we now have 26 parties to the UNFCCC Convention and 39% of global greenhouse emissions accounted for."
"144",3,"G20-2016","I urge all leaders, particularly, including the leaders from G20 countries, to show their leadership by accelerating their domestic ratification processes so we can turn the aspirations of Paris into the transformative climate action the world so urgently needs."
"145",3,"G20-2016","Legal processes must be concluded in parallel with a renewed commitment by all the countries to honour their pledges, particularly the OECD Member States, in terms of financial and technical support, including through the Green Climate Fund to many vulnerable countries, developing countries so that they can adjust to this situation, this climate change.
We need to keep this momentum."

"147",14,"G20-2016","In Myanmar, I was encouraged to participate in the Twenty-first Century Panglong Conference in Myanmar, a critical juncture in the seventy-year history of conflict and division between the Union Government and armed ethnic groups.
The success of this peace process is in the vital interest of all the people of Myanmar, regardless of ethnicity, religion, political affiliation or socio-economic status.

"160",3,"G20-2018","
At the moment, we are headed for a world of cataclysm and uncertainty due to climate disruption.
"
"161",3,"G20-2018","
The social, economic and environmental costs of climate change dwarf the costs of acting now.
"
"162",16,"G20-2018","
Failure to act means more disasters and emergencies and air pollution that could cost the global economy as much as US$21 trillion by 2050.

"167",4,"G20-2019","Good morning, this G20 meeting takes place in a moment of high tension, high political tension."
"168",3,"G20-2019","We have global warming, but we have also global political warming, and this can be seen in relation to trade and technology conflicts, it can be seen in relation to situations in several parts of the world, namely the Gulf."

"170",16,"G20-2019","And it is also a moment in which there are uncertainties about the global economy – uncertainties due to trade conflicts, but also uncertainties related to high levels of debt, to potential instability in financial markets, the risk of slowdown in global growth, and obviously, in a situation like this, even if I pay tribute to the very committed engagements of the Government of Japan and the Prime Minister of Japan for meaningful conclusions of this summit, it is clear that it will be very difficult to have a breakthrough in relation to some of the most difficult challenges that the international community is facing.
But, of course, the UN is not part of the G20, we are not members of the G20, but I am grateful for this opportunity to address the leaders and to convey to them our concerns."
"171",3,"G20-2019","And I will today, essentially mention two: first, climate change, second, the implementation of the Agenda 2030.
And in both, we are lagging behind."

"173",3,"G20-2019","We are seeing heat waves in Europe, drought in Africa, storms happening also in Africa and the Caribbean, even the United States.
We are seeing a multiplication of natural disasters that are becoming more intense, more dramatic, with worsening humanitarian consequences and more frequent.
And we are seeing glaciers melting, corals bleaching, the Arctic with the lowest levels ever in relation to the parts covered by ice.
We see the melting in Greenland and Antarctica, it’s extremely worrying."

"175",3,"G20-2019","I believe in what has been considered by the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] report, the most valid scientific position today, which is that we need to make sure that we do not reach more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming at the end of the century."
"176",3,"G20-2019","And that is reason why I'm convening a climate summit in New York in September, and that is the reason why I will be appealing to the leaders here in relation to a much stronger commitment of their countries for climate action, and there are many aspects of that that are absolutely essential on this: putting a price on carbon, ending subsidies to fossil fuels, not accepting the idea that we still have an acceleration of the construction of coal power plants, and many other aspects of that that are extremely relevant in order to make sure that we are able to abide by what the scientific community is telling us is absolutely essential to rescue the planet."
"177",3,"G20-2019","And so an appeal, an appeal for a much stronger commitment of the members of the G20 that represent 80 per cent of the emissions in climate change and that represent a very important area of international financial and economic cooperation, and an appeal for a much stronger engagement for an enhanced commitment in order to be able to avoid the present situation in which climate change is running faster than what we are and we are lagging behind in the implementation of the Agenda 2030."

"179",16,"G20-2011-nicolas-sarkozy","In two days of very intense discussions in an atmosphere dominated both by the gravity of the situation and the international community’s need for unity, we’ve worked on both short-term challenges to reduce the impact of the crises and, in the long term, putting the global economy back on the path of growth."
"180",8,"G20-2011-nicolas-sarkozy","The first point is Europe’s firm stance towards Greece, which led to a crucial collective realization of the challenges for that great country’s future. The conditions are currently being created for consensus in Greece on the 26 October agreement, and we’re really delighted that the atmosphere in Greece today bears no resemblance at the end of this week to what it was at the beginning of last week."
"181",16,"G20-2011-nicolas-sarkozy","Secondly on the European crisis, I’d like to pay tribute to the effort of Italy, who has taken the necessary measures to restore confidence, balance the budget as early as 2013 and strengthen her growth. Italy is a key Euro Area country, one of the world’s largest economies, and I want to welcome Italy’s decision to call upon the European Commission and IMF to certify the results obtained, on a quarterly basis, with the results being published and these assessments of course being made public."
"182",16,"G20-2011-nicolas-sarkozy","Finally, we made a commitment to increase the IMF’s resources if it was felt necessary. And we established the conditions for achieving this goal. The IMF must fulfil its role as a firewall against systemic risk; at their next meeting in February the finance ministers have been instructed to deploy several options to achieve an increase in those resources: the allocation of SDRs, bilateral loans to the IMF and specific accounts at the IMF. We didn’t decide between these different methods, but the approach is indeed to boost the IMF’s resources."
"183",16,"G20-2011-nicolas-sarkozy","Moreover, those countries which have large foreign trade surpluses are pledging to increase domestic demand and speed up the flexibility of their exchange regimes in order to reduce currency reserve accumulation in the medium term. You can see very clearly the great country that has made these commitments, and that’s excellent news.
"
"184",2,"G20-2011-nicolas-sarkozy","Finally – and it’s a great novelty – the Action Plan for Growth and Jobs fully takes into account the social dimension of globalization. It’s the first time the G20 countries, and particularly the emerging countries, have expressed their determination to establish social protection floors."
"185",8,"G20-2011-nicolas-sarkozy",". We don’t want any more tax havens. The message is very clear. We don’t want any more of them. And those countries which continue to be tax havens, through opacity in banking, will be deemed pariahs in the international community. Things have made a lot of progress; they must make further progress"

"190",9,"G20-2011-nicolas-sarkozy","Let me be very clear: France believes that, in order to be meet the development challenges, there has to be innovative financing, given the deficit in every country. And we said in the communiqué that, in Bill Gates’ report, there are a number of innovative financing mechanisms and that every country pledges at least to adopt one of these."
