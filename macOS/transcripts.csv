"1","G20-2010-obama","Good afternoon, everybody.
Before I discuss the G20, I want to briefly comment on the agreement in Iraq that's taken place on the framework for a new government.
There’s still challenges to overcome, but all indications are that the government will be representative, inclusive, and reflect the will of the Iraqi people who cast their ballots in the last election.

This agreement marks another milestone in the history of modern Iraq.
Once again, Iraqis are showing their determination to unify Iraq and build its future and that those impulses are far stronger than those who want Iraq to descend into sectarian war and terror.

For the last several months, the United States has worked closely with our Iraqi partners to promote a broad-based government -- one whose leaders share a commitment to serving all Iraqis as equal citizens.
Now, Iraq's leaders must finish the job of forming their government so that they can meet the challenges that a diverse coalition will inevitably face.
And going forward, we will support the Iraqi people as they strengthen their democracy, resolve political disputes, resettle those displaced by war, and build ties of commerce and cooperation with the United States, the region and the world.

Now, here in Seoul, once again, we are very grateful to our hosts -- President Lee, and the people of Seoul and South Korea  -- for your extraordinary hospitality.

We came to Seoul to continue the work that has taken us from London to Pittsburgh to Toronto.
We worked together to pull the global economy back from catastrophe.
To avoid the old cycles of boom and bust that led to that crisis, we committed ourselves to growth that is balanced and sustained, including financial reform and fiscal responsibility.

The actions we took were not always easy or popular.
But they were necessary.
As a result, the global economy is growing again.
Some economies, especially emerging economies, are experiencing strong economic growth.
Trade has risen.
Jobs are being created, as in the United States, where we’ve had 10 consecutive months of private sector job growth and created more than one million private sector jobs this year alone.

In short, we succeeded in putting the global economy back on the path of recovery -- but we also know that the progress has not come nearly fast enough, especially when it comes to my highest priority, which is putting Americans back to work.

Nor have we yet achieved the balanced global growth that we need.
Many advanced economies are growing too slowly and not creating enough jobs.
Some countries are running large surpluses, others running large deficits.
Put simply, we risk slipping back into the old imbalances that contributed to the economic crisis in the first place and which threaten global recovery.

So here in Seoul, the question was whether our nations could work together to keep the global economy growing.
I know the commentary tends to focus on the inevitable areas of disagreement, but the fact is the 20 major economies gathered here are in broad agreement on the way forward -- an agreement that is based on a framework that was put forward by the United States.
And for the first time, we spelled out the actions that are required -- in four key areas -- to achieve the sustained and balanced growth that we need.

First, we agreed to keep focusing on growth.
At home, the United States has been doing our part by making historic investments in infrastructure and education, research and clean energy.
And as a consequence, our economy is growing again -– even as we must do more to ensure that that growth is sustained and translates into jobs for our people.

Here at Seoul, we agreed that growth must be balanced.
Countries with large deficits must work to reduce them, as we are doing in the United States, where we’re on track to cut our deficit in half by 2013, and where I’m prepared to make tough decisions to achieve that goal.
Likewise, countries with large surpluses must shift away from unhealthy dependence on exports and take steps to boost domestic demand.
As I’ve said, going forward, no nation should assume that their path to prosperity is paved simply with exports to the United States.

Second, we agreed that exchange rates must reflect economic realities.
Just as the major advanced economies need to keep working to preserve stability among reserve currencies, emerging economies need to allow for currencies that are market-driven. This is something that I raised yesterday with President Hu of China, and we will continue to closely watch the appreciation of China’s currency.
All of us need to avoid actions that perpetuate imbalances and give countries an undue advantage over one another.

Third, we took further steps to implement financial regulatory reform.
At home, we are implementing the toughest financial reform since the Great Depression, and we are expecting the same sense of urgency, rather than complacency, among our G20 partners.
Here in Seoul we agreed to new standards -- similar to those that we’ve passed in the United States -- to make sure that banks have the capital they need to withstand shocks and not take excessive risks that could lead to another crisis.
And we agreed on an approach to ensure that taxpayers are not asked to pay for future bank failures.

Fourth, we agreed to focus on development as a key driver of economic growth.
The work we did here today builds on a new development policy that I announced in September and recognizes that the most effective means of lifting people out of poverty is to create sustainable economic growth -– growth that will create the markets of the future.
We also agreed on an action plan to combat corruption, which in some countries is the single greatest barrier to economic progress.

Finally, we reaffirmed the need to avoid protectionism that stifles growth and instead pursue trade and investment through open markets.
That’s why, for example, we will continue to work towards a U.S.-Korea free trade agreement in the coming weeks -- not just any agreement, but the best agreement to create jobs both in America and Korea.

And that's why I spoke very frankly to my G20 partners today about the prospects of the Doha Round.
For just as emerging economies have gained a greater voice at international financial institutions -- in part because of the work we've done here at the G20 -- so, too, must they embrace their responsibilities to open markets to the trade and investment that creates jobs in all our countries.

So, again, I want to thank our South Korean hosts for a very successful summit.
I want to thank my fellow leaders for their partnership.
Here in Seoul, we’ve laid out the steps we must take to realize the balanced and sustained growth that we need.
And now and in the days ahead, these are the commitments that we’re going to have to meet.

So with that, let me take a few questions. "
"2","G20-2011-obama"," Good afternoon, everybody.
I want to begin by thanking my friend, President Sarkozy, for his leadership and his hospitality.
And I want to thank the people of Cannes for this extraordinary setting.

Over the past two years, those of us in the G20 have worked together to rescue the global economy, to avert another depression, and to put us on the path to recovery.
But we came to Cannes with no illusions.
The recovery has been fragile.
And since our last meeting in Seoul we’ve experienced a number of new shocks -- disruptions in oil supplies, the tragic tsunami in Japan, and the financial crisis in Europe.

As a result, advanced economies, including the United States are growing and creating jobs, but not nearly fast enough.
Emerging economies have started to slow.
Global demand is weakening.
Around the world, hundreds of millions of people are unemployed, or underemployed.
Put simply, the world faces challenges that put our economic recovery at risk. 

So the central question coming into Cannes was this:  Could the world’s largest economies confront this challenge squarely -- understanding that these problems will not be solved overnight, could we make progress?  After two days of very substantive discussions I can say that we’ve come together and made important progress to put our economic recoveries on a firmer footing. 

With respect to Europe, we came to Cannes to discuss with our European friends how they will move forward and build upon the plan they agreed to last week to resolve this crisis.
Events in Greece over the past 24 hours have underscored the importance of implementing the plan, fully and as quickly as possible. 

Having heard from our European partners over the past two days, I am confidence that Europe has the capacity to meet this challenge.
I know it isn’t easy, but what is absolutely critical, and what the world looks for in moments such as this, is action. 

That’s how we confronted our financial crisis in the United States -- having our banks submit to stress tests that were rigorous, increasing capital buffers, and passing the strongest financial reforms since the Great Depression.
None of that was easy, and it certainly wasn’t always popular.
But we did what was necessary to address the crisis, put ourselves on a stronger footing, and help rescue the global economy. 

And that’s the challenge that Europe now faces.
Make no mistake, there's more hard work ahead and more difficult choices to make.
But our European partners have laid a foundation on which to build, and it has all the elements needed for success:  a credible firewall to prevent the crisis from spreading, strengthening European banks, charting a sustainable path for Greece, and confronting the structural issues that are at the heart of the current crisis.

And here in Cannes we’ve moved the ball forward.
Europe remains on track to implement a sustainable path for Greece.
Italy has agreed to a monitoring program with the IMF -- in fact, invited it.
Tools have been identified that will better enable the world to support European action.
And European finance ministers will carry this work forward next week.

All of us have an enormous interest in Europe's success, and all of us will be affected if Europe is not growing -- and that certainly includes the United States, which counts Europe as our largest trading partner.
If Europe isn't growing, it's harder for us to do what we need to do for the American people:  creating jobs, lifting up the middle class, and putting our fiscal house in order.
And that's why I've made it clear that the United States will continue to do our part to support our European partners as they work to resolve this crisis.

More broadly, we agreed to stay focused on jobs and growth with an action plan in which each nation does its part.
In the United States, we recognize, as the world's largest economy, the most important thing we can do for global growth is to get our own economy growing faster.
Back home, we're fighting for the American Jobs Act, which will put people back to work, even as we meet our responsibilities to reduce our deficit in the coming years.

We also made progress here in Cannes on our rebalancing agenda.
In an important step forward, countries with large surpluses and export-oriented countries agreed to take additional steps to support growth and boost demand in their own countries. In addition, we welcome China's determination to increase the flexibility of the RMB.
This is something we've been calling for for some time, and it will be a critical step in boosting growth.

Finally, we also made progress across a range of challenges to our shared prosperity.
Following our reforms in the United States, the G20 adopted an unprecedented set of high-level financial reforms to prevent a crisis in the future.
We agreed to keep phasing out fossil fuel subsidies -- perhaps the single-most important step we can take in the near term to fight climate change and create clean-energy economies. 

And even as our countries work to save lives from the drought and terrible famine in the Horn of Africa, we agreed on the need to mobilize new resources to support the development that lifts nations out of poverty.

So, again, I want to thank President Sarkozy and our French hosts for a productive summit.
I want to thank my fellow leaders for their partnership and for the progress we've made to create the jobs and prosperity that our people deserve.

So with that, let me take a few questions"
"3","G20-2012-obama","I want to begin by thanking my good friend and partner, President Calderon, and the people of Los Cabos and Mexico for their outstanding hospitality and leadership.
Mexico is the first Latin American country to host a G20 summit, and this has been another example of Mexico playing a larger role in world affairs, from the global economy to climate change to development.


Since this is my last visit to Mexico during President Calderon’s time in office, I want to say how much I’ve valued Felipe’s friendship and the progress that we’ve made together over the past several years.
And building on the spirit here at Los Cabos, I’m absolutely confident that the deep ties between our countries will only grow stronger in the years to come.


Now, over the past three years, these G20 summits have allowed our nations to pull the global economy back from a free fall and put us back on the path of recovery and growth.
In the United States, our businesses have created jobs for 27 months in a row -- more than 4 million jobs in all -- and our highest priority continues to be putting people back to work even faster.
 
Today, we recognize that there are a wide range of threats to our ongoing global economic recovery and growth.
But the one that’s received the most focus obviously and that does have a significant impact on the United States as well as globally is the situation in Europe.
As our largest trading partner, slower growth in Europe means slower growth in American jobs.
So we have a profound interest in seeing Europe prosper.
That’s why I’ve been consulting closely with my European counterparts during this crisis, as we’ve done here at Los Cabos.

I do think it’s important to note, however, that most leaders of the eurozone, the economies are not part of the G20.
The challenges facing Europe will not be solved by the G20 or by the United States.
The solutions will be debated and decided, appropriately, by the leaders and the people of Europe. 

So this has been an opportunity for us to hear from European leaders on the progress they’re making and on their next steps -- especially in the wake of the election in Greece, and because they’re heading into the EU summit later this month.
It’s also been a chance for the international community, including the United States -- the largest economy in the world, and with our own record of responding to financial crises -- to stress the importance of decisive action at this moment.

Now, markets around the world as well as governments have been asking if Europe is ready to do what is necessary to hold the eurozone together.
Over the last two days European leaders here in Cabos have made it clear that they understand the stakes and they pledged to take the actions needed to address this crisis and restore confidence, stability, and growth.
Let me just be a little more specific. 

First, our friends in Europe clearly grasp the seriousness of the situation and are moving forward with a heightened sense of urgency.
I welcome the important steps that they have already taken to promote growth, financial stability and fiscal responsibility.
I’m very pleased that the European leaders here said that they will take all necessary measures to safeguard the integrity and stability of the eurozone, to improve the functioning of the financial markets.
This will contribute to breaking the feedback loop between sovereigns and banks, and make sovereign borrowing costs sustainable. 

I also welcome the adoption of the fiscal compact and it’s ongoing implementation, assessed on a structural basis, together with a growth strategy which includes structural reforms. 

G20 leaders all supported Europe working in partnership with the next Greek government to ensure that they remain on a path to reform and sustainability within the eurozone.
Another positive step forward was the eurozone’s commitment to work on a more integrated financial architecture -- including banking supervision, resolution, and recapitalization, as well as deposit insurance.
Also, in the coming days Spain will lay out the details of its financial support request for its banks restructuring agency, providing clarity to reassure markets on the form and the amount and the structure of support to be approved at the earliest time. 

It’s also positive that the eurozone will pursue structural reforms to strengthen competitiveness in deficit countries, and to promote demand and growth in surplus countries to reduce imbalances within the euro area.

And finally, I welcome the fact that Europe is determined to move forward quickly on measures to support growth and investment including by completing the European single market and making better use of European funds. 

Of course, Europe is not, as I said, the only source of concern when it comes to global growth.
The G20 also agreed that reversing the economic slowdown demands a renewed focus on growth and job creation.

As the world’s largest economy, the best thing the United States can do is to create jobs and growth in the short term, even as we continue to put our fiscal house in order over the long term.
And as part of that effort, we’ve made significant progress in advancing our trade agenda.
This is an essential to promoting growth, innovation and jobs in the United States.

Here in Los Cabos, we announced important steps towards closer integration with three of our major trading partners.
Both Mexico and Canada have been invited to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, which is an ambitious 21st century trade agreement that will now include 11 countries.
And this agreement holds enormous opportunities to boost trade in one of the world’s fastest growing regions. 

Even as we build this new framework for trade in the Asia Pacific, we’re also working to expand our trade with Europe.
So today, the United States and the European Union agreed to take the next step in our work towards the possible launching of negotiations on an agreement to strengthen our already very deep trade and investment partnership.

In addition, and in keeping with our commitments at the last G20 in Cannes, we agreed that countries should not intervene to hold their currencies at undervalued levels, and that countries with large surpluses and export-oriented economies needed to continue to boost demand.

So, in closing, I’d note that with Mexico’s leadership, we continue to make progress across a range of challenges that are vital to our shared prosperity -- from food security to Greek economic growth that combats climate change, from financial education and protection for consumers to combating corruption that stifles economic growth, and in strengthening financial regulation to creating a more level playing field.
All of this happened in large part because of the leadership of President Calderón.
I want to thank him, and I want to thank my fellow leaders for their partnership as we work very hard to create jobs and opportunity that all of our citizens deserve.

So with that, I’m going to start with Ben Feller of AP."
"4","G20-2013-obama","Good evening.
Let me begin by thanking President Putin and the people of St. Petersburg and the people of Russia for hosting this G20.
This city has a long and storied history, including its heroic resistance and extraordinary sacrifices during the Second World War.
So I want to take this opportunity to salute the people of St. Petersburg and express our gratitude for their outstanding hospitality.
 
This summit marks another milestone in the world’s recovery from the financial crisis that erupted five years ago this month.
Instead of the looming threat of another financial meltdown, we’re focused for the first time in many years on building upon the gains that we’ve made.
For the first time in three years, instead of an urgent discussion to address the European financial crisis, we see a Europe that has emerged from recession. 
 
Moreover, the United States is a source of strength in the global economy.
Our manufacturing sector is rebounding.
New rules have strengthened our banks and reduced the chance of another crisis.
We’re reducing our addiction to foreign oil and producing more clean energy.
And as we learned today, over the past three and a half years, our businesses have created seven and a half million new jobs -- a pace of more than 2 million jobs each year.
We’ve put more people back to work, but we’ve also cleared away the rubble of crisis and laid the foundation for stronger and more durable economic growth.
 
We’re also making progress in putting our fiscal house in order.
Our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years.
And as Congress takes up important decisions in the coming months, I’m going to keep making the case for the smart investments and fiscal responsibility that keep our economy growing, creates jobs and keeps the U.S. competitive.
That includes making sure we don’t risk a U.S. default over paying bills we’ve already racked up.
I'm determined that the world has confidence in the full faith and credit of the United States.
 
As the world’s largest economy, our recovery is helping to drive global growth.
And in the emerging markets in particular, there’s a recognition that a strong U.S. economy is good for their economies, too. 
 
Yet we came to St. Petersburg mindful of the challenges that remain.
As it emerges from recession, Europe has an opportunity to focus on boosting demand and reducing unemployment, as well as making some of the structural changes that can increase long-term growth.
Growth in emerging economies has slowed, so we need to make sure that we are working with them in managing this process. And I’m pleased that over the past two days we reached a consensus on how to proceed.
 
We agreed that our focus needs to be on creating jobs and growth that put people back to work.
We agreed on ways to encourage the investments in infrastructure that keep economies competitive.
Nations agreed to continue pursuing financial reforms and to address tax evasion and tax avoidance, which undermines budgets and unfairly shifts the tax burden to other taxpayers. 
 
We’re moving ahead with our development agenda, with a focus on issues like food security and combating corruption.
And I’m very pleased that the G20 nations agreed to make faster progress on phasing down certain greenhouse gases a priority.
That's an important step in our fight against climate change. 
 
During my trip, we also continued our efforts to advance two key trade initiatives:  the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
And I believe that if we continue to move forward on all the fronts that I’ve described, we can keep the global economy growing and keep creating jobs for our people.
 
Of course, even as we’ve focused on our shared prosperity, and although the primary task of the G20 is to focus on our joint efforts to boost the global economy, we did also discuss a grave threat to our shared security and that’s the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons.
And what I’ve been emphasizing and will continue to stress is that the Assad regime’s brazen use of chemical weapons isn’t just a Syrian tragedy.
It’s a threat to global peace and security.
 
Syria’s escalating use of chemical weapons threatens its neighbors -- Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Israel.
It threatens to further destabilize the Middle East.
It increases the risk that these weapons will fall into the hands of terrorist groups. But, more broadly, it threatens to unravel the international norm against chemical weapons embraced by 189 nations, and those nations represent 98 percent of the world’s people. 
 
Failing to respond to this breach of this international norm would send a signal to rogue nations, authoritarian regimes, and terrorist organizations that they can develop and use weapons of mass destruction and not pay a consequence.
And that’s not the world that we want to live in.
 
This is why nations around the world have condemned Syria for this attack and called for action.
I’ve been encouraged by discussions with my fellow leaders this week; there is a growing recognition that the world cannot stand idly by.
Here in St. Petersburg, leaders from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East have come together to say that the international norm against the use of chemical weapons must be upheld, and that the Assad regime used these weapons on its own people, and that, as a consequence, there needs to be a strong response. 
 
The Arab League foreign ministers have said the Assad regime is responsible and called for “deterrent and necessary measures against the culprits of this crime.”  The Organization of Islamic Cooperation -- its general secretariat has called the attack a “blatant affront to all religious and moral values and a deliberate disregard of international laws and norms, which requires a decisive action.” 
 
So, in the coming days, I’ll continue to consult with my fellow leaders around the world, and I will continue to consult with Congress.
And I will make the best case that I can to the American people, as well as to the international community, for taking necessary and appropriate action.
And I intend to address the American people from the White House on Tuesday.
 
The kind of world we live in and our ability to deter this kind of outrageous behavior is going to depend on the decisions that we make in the days ahead.
And I’m confident that if we deliberate carefully and we choose wisely, and embrace our responsibilities, we can meet the challenges of this moment as well as those in the days ahead.
 
So with that, let me take some questions.
I’ve got my handy list.
And I will start with Julie Pace from AP."
"5","G20-2014-obama","Thank you, everybody.
Please have a seat.

Good afternoon.

I want to begin by thanking Prime Minister Abbott, the people of Brisbane, and the people of Australia for being such extraordinary hosts for the G20.
All the arrangements were terrific and, as always, the people of Australia could not have been friendlier and better organized.
So I very much appreciate everything that you have done.


We had a lot of good discussions during the course of the G20, but as our Australian friends say, this wasn’t just a “good old chinwag.”
I really love that expression.
(Laughter.)
It was a productive summit.
And so I want to thank Tony for his leadership, and the people of Brizzy truly did shine throughout this process with their hospitality.


This is the final day of a trip that has taken me across the Asia Pacific -- a visit that comes against the backdrop of America’s renewed economic strength.
The United States is in the longest stretch of uninterrupted private sector job growth in its history.
Over the last few years, we’ve put more people back to work than all the other advanced economies combined.
And this growing economic strength at home set the stage for the progress that we have made on this trip.
It’s been a good week for American leadership and for American workers.


We made important progress in our efforts to open markets to U.S. goods and to boost the exports that support American jobs.
We continue to make progress toward the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Our agreement with China to extend visas for business people, tourists and students is going to boost tourism, grow our two economies and create jobs for Americans and Chinese alike.
We also agreed with China to pursue a bilateral investment treaty, as well as agreeing on an approach to the Information Technology Agreement that is estimated would support some 60,000 American jobs.
And here at the G20, China committed to greater transparency on its economic data, including its foreign exchange reserves.
And this is a step toward the market-driven exchange rate that we’ve been pushing for because it would promote a level playing field for American businesses and American workers.


Here in Brisbane, all the G20 countries announced strategies to increase growth and put people back to work, including a new initiative to support jobs by building infrastructure.
Our nations made commitments that could bring another 100 million women into our collective workforce.
We took new steps toward strengthening our banks, closing tax loopholes for multinational companies, and stopping tax evaders and criminals from hiding behind shell companies.
And these were all very specific provisions.
These were not just goals that were set without any substance behind them.
We have made very concrete progress during the course of the last several G20 sessions in preventing companies from avoiding the taxes that they owe in their home countries, including the United States, and making sure that we’ve got a financial system that’s more stable and that can allow a bank to fail without taxpayers having to bail them out.


Meanwhile, the breakthrough the United States achieved with India this week allows for a resumption of talks on a global trade deal that would mean more growth and prosperity for all of us.


This week, we also took historic steps in the fight against climate change.
The ambitious new goal that I announced in Beijing will double the pace at which America reduces its carbon pollution while growing our economy and creating jobs, strengthening our energy security, and putting us on the path to a low carbon future.
Combined with China’s commitment -- China for the first time committed to slowing and then peaking and then reversing the course of its emissions -- we’re showing that there’s no excuse for other nations to come together, both developed and developing, to achieve a strong global climate agreement next year.


The $3 billion contribution to the Green Climate Fund that I announced yesterday will help developing nations deal with climate change, reduce their carbon pollution and invest in clean energy.
I want to commend, by the way, Prime Minister Abe and Japan for their $1.
5 billion pledge to the Fund.
And following the steps we’ve taken in the United States, many of the G20 countries agreed to work to improve the efficiency of heavy-duty vehicles, which would be another major step in reducing emissions.


And finally, I’m pleased that more nations are stepping up and joining the United States in the effort to end the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.
Coming on the heels of our Global Health Security Agenda in the United States, the G20 countries committed to helping nations like those in West Africa to build their capacity to prevent, detect and respond to future outbreaks before they become epidemics.


So from trade to climate change to the fight against Ebola, this was a strong week for American leadership.
And the results will be more jobs for the American people; historic steps towards a cleaner and healthier planet; and progress towards saving lives not just in West Africa, but eventually in other places.
If you ask me, I’d say that’s a pretty good week.
The American people can be proud of the progress that we’ve made.
I intend to build on that momentum when I return home tomorrow.


And with that, I am going to take a few questions.
I’ve got my cheat-sheet here"
"6","greta-thunberg-un-climate-change-conference-speech-transcript","Hi.
A year and a half ago, I didn’t speak to anyone unless I really had to, but then I found a reason to speak.
Since then, I’ve given many speeches and learned that when you talk in public, you start with something personal or emotional to get everyone’s attention.
Say things like, our house is on fire, I wanted to panic or how dare you.

But today I will not do that because then those phrases are all that people focus on.
They don’t remember the facts, the very reason why I say those things in the first place, we no longer have time to leave out the science.
For about a year I have been constantly talking about our rapidly declining carbon budgets over and over again.
But since that is still being ignored, I will just keep repeating it.

In chapter two, on page 108 in the SR 1.5 IPCC report that came out last year, it says that if we ought to have a 6% to 7% chance of limiting the global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, we had on January 1, 2018, 420 gigatons of CO2 left two emit in that budget.
And of course that number is much lower today as we emit about 42 gigatons of CO2 every year including land use.

With today’s emissions levels, that remaining budget will be gone within about eight years.
These numbers aren’t anyone’s opinions or political views.
This is the current best available science.
Though many scientists suggest these figures or too moderate.
These are the ones that have been accepted through the IPCC, and please note that these figures are global and therefore do not say anything about the aspect of equity, which is absolutely essential to make the Paris Agreement to work on a global scale.

That means that richer countries need to do their fair share and get down to real zero emissions much faster and then help poorer countries do the same, so people in less fortunate parts of the world can raise their living standards.
These numbers also don’t include most feedback loops, nonlinear tipping points, or additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution.

Most models assume, however, that future generations will somehow be able to suck hundreds of billions of tons of CO2 out of the air with technologies that do not exist in the scale required and maybe never will.
The approximate 6% to 7% chance budget is the one with the highest odds given by the IPCC.
And now we have less than 340 gigatons of CO2 left to emit in that budget to share fairly.

Why is it so important to stay below 1.5 degrees? Because even at one degree people are dying from the climate crisis.
Because that is what the United Science calls for to avoid destabilizing the climates.
So that we have the best possible chance to avoid setting off irreversible chain reactions such as melting glaciers, polar ice and thawing Arctic permafrost.
Every fraction of a degree matters.
So there it is, again.
This is my message.
This is what I want you to focus on.

So please tell me, how do you react to these numbers without feeling at least some level of panic? How do you respond to the fact that basically nothing is being done about this without feeling the slightest bit of anger? And how do you communicate this without sounding alarmist? I would really like to know.
Since the Paris Agreement, global banks have invested 1.9 trillion U.S.
dollars in fossil fuels.
One hundred companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions.
The G20 countries account for almost 80% of total emissions.
The richest 10% of the world’s population produce half of our CO2 emissions, while the poorest 50% account for just one tenth.
We indeed have some work to do, but some more than others.

Recently, a handful of rich countries pledged to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases by so-and-so many percent by this or that date or to become climate neutral or net zero in so-and-so many years.
This may sound impressive at first glance, but even though the intentions may be good, this is not leadership.
This is not leading.
This is misleading because most of these pledges do not include aviation, shipping, and imported and exported goods and consumption.
They do, however, include the possibility of countries to offset their emissions elsewhere.

These pledges don’t include the immediate yearly reduction rates needed for wealthy countries, which is necessary to stay within the remaining tiny budget.
Zero in 2050 means nothing, if high emission continues even for a few years, then the remaining budget will be gone.
Without seeing the full picture, we will not solve this crisis.
Finding holistic solutions is what the cup should be all about, but instead it seems to have turned into some kind of opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition.

Countries are finding clever ways around having to take real action.
Like double counting emissions reductions and moving their emissions overseas and walking back on their promises to increase ambition or refusing to pay for solutions or loss of damage.
This has to stop.
What we need is real drastic emission cuts at the source, but of course just reducing emissions is not enough.
Our greenhouse gas emissions has to stop.
To stay below 1.5 degrees.
We need to keep the carbon in the ground.
Only setting up distant dates and saying things which give the impression of the action is underway will most likely do more harm than good because the changes required are still nowhere in site.
The politics needed does not exist today despite what you might hear from world leaders.
And I still believe that the biggest danger is not inaction.
The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening when in fact almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR.

I have been fortunate enough to be able to travel around the world.
And my experience is that the lack of awareness is the same everywhere, not the least amongst those elected to lead us.
There is no sense of urgency whatsoever.
Our leaders are not behaving as if we were in an emergency.
In an emergency you change your behavior.
If there is a child standing in the middle of the road and cars are coming at full speed, you don’t look away because it’s too uncomfortable.
You immediately run out and rescue that child.
And without that sense of urgency, how can we, the people understand that we are facing a real crisis.
And if the people are not fully aware of what is going on, then they will not put pressure on the people in power to act.
And without pressure from the people our leaders can get away with basically not doing anything, which is where we are now.
And around and around it goes.

In just three weeks.
We will enter a new decade, a decade that will define our future.
Right now we are desperate for any sign of hope.
Well, I’m telling you, there is hope.
I have seen it, but it does not come from the governments or corporations.
It comes from the people.
The people who have been unaware, but are now starting to wake up.
And once we become aware, we change.
People can change.
People are ready for change.
And that is the hope because we have democracy and democracy is happening all the time.
Not just on election day, but every second and every hour.
It is public opinion that runs the free world.
In fact, every great change throughout history has come from the people.
We do not have to wait.
We can start the change right now.
We the people.
Thank you."
"7","G20-2014","

Good morning, Bonjour.

It is a great pleasure to see you today.
Thank you for your commitment in covering climate change discussions.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Before I focus on climate change, let me just say a few words, with the understanding of the two Presidents.
It was not scheduled, but I need to say something about the situation in Syria.

Please note that we will take questions only on climate change.

I am going to say something about the United Nations position on Syria.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

For more than a year, I have sounded the alarm bells about the brutality of extremist armed groups in Syria and the critical threat they pose to Syria and to international peace and security.
While the rise of these extremist groups in Syria is a consequence and not a cause of Syria's tragic civil war, there can be no justification for their barbarity and the suffering they impose on the Syrian people.

I welcome the international solidarity to confront this challenge, as demonstrated by the unanimous passage of Security Council Resolution 2170 just a few weeks ago.

Confronting terrorist groups operating in Syria requires a multi-facetted approach.
This approach should be designed to address the immediate security risks, to stop atrocity crimes and, over the longer term, to eliminate the conditions in which these groups take root.

I urge the world leaders gathered in New York, especially those participating in tomorrow’s Security Council Summit on foreign terrorist fighters, to come together decisively in support of efforts to confront these groups.
As the custodian of the principles of the United Nations, I would like to underscore the importance that all measures must be fully in line with the Charter of the United Nations and need to operate strictly in accordance with international humanitarian law.

I have placed the protection of civilians at the top of my agenda.
In the case of Syria, there can be no genuine protection if extremist groups are permitted to act with impunity and if the Syrian Government continues to commit gross human rights violations against its own citizens.
Protecting the Syrian people requires immediate action, but action that is rooted in the principles of the United Nations.

I regret the loss of any civilian lives as a result of strikes against targets in Syria.
The parties involved in this campaign must abide by international humanitarian law and take all necessary precautions to avoid and minimize civilian casualties.
I am aware that today’s strikes were not carried out at the direct request of the Syrian Government, but I note that the Government was informed beforehand.
I also note that the strikes took place in areas no longer under the effective control of that Government.

I think it is undeniable – and the subject of broad international consensus – that these extremist groups pose an immediate threat to international peace and security.

Thank you for your attention.
Now let me turn to climate change,the subject of this press conference.

I am honoured to be joined by a number of very important guests.

Climate change has been a priority for me since I took office.

We need to take action now to limit global temperature rise.

We need all hands on deck to ride this storm.

That is why I called this Summit.

This gathering is unprecedented.

More than 120 world leaders, joined by many more business, finance and civil society leaders have come to focus on climate change.

But this Summit is not about talk.

The Climate Summit is producing actions that make a difference.

This weekend hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets around the world to demand leadership – and results.

I joined the marchers here in New York.

They gave me the box with 2 million signatures.

They asked me to bring their voices into the halls of the United Nations.

That is what I have done.

Our duty now is to listen.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced this morning that New York City is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by 2050.

Today a coalition of more than 200 mayors, representing 400 million people, will sign a Mayor’s Compact to reduce annual emissions by between 12.4 and 16.4 per cent.

Announcements on agriculture and forests will highlight a commitment by many of the world’s largest and most well-known companies to adapt their supply chains to reduce emissions and build resilience to climate change.

They will assist 500 million farmers in the process.

Oil and gas companies are today announcing initiatives that will advance efforts to curb the release of methane gas, a highly potent greenhouse gas.

Some of the largest financial institutions, investors, banks and insurance companies will announce that they will shift more than 200 billion dollars toward building low-carbon economies by 2015.

Countries are also making significant national announcements.

I would now like to turn to the leaders of France and Peru, who will be leading the negotiating process toward a meaningful universal climate [agreement.]

They are here to announce their national actions to address climate change.
I would like to invite President Hollande to speak, followed by President Humala.

[President Francois Hollande of France; President Ollanta Humala of Peru; Dr.
Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, Chair of the African Union; President of the World Bank, Dr.
Jim Yong Kim, Mr.
Eduardo Paes, Mayor of Rio de Janeiro; Mr.
Helge Lund, CEO of the Statoil Group; Mr.
Mats Andersson, CEO of AP4 and Mr.
David Maclennan, President and CEO of Cargill then addressed the media]

Ladies and gentlemen, I have been repeating many, many times, but let me just repeat what I have been saying.
I was told that communication is repetition.
Just a one-time message may not be sufficient, therefore I am again – even though you have heard a lot of eloquent speakers during this morning – but I have to repeat again.

Climate change is the defining issue of our time.
It is not a distant threat.
It is coming and approaching much, much faster than we may think.
The United Nations was flooded for the first time in 70 years.

All of us have a stake in this fight – and all of us can make a difference.

Every action counts – large and small.
The tendency is that they only look to the Governments, but now all business communities are on board, and even the individual person - they can make a difference.
Just using sparingly even one single jug of water, or sparing use of electricity – all this will make a difference.

We cannot negotiate with Mother Nature.
Mother Nature does not wait.
So it is us human beings who have to adapt to the changing situation.

There can be no Plan B because we don’t have a Planet B.
The way we consume seems to suggest that we have another planet Earth.
We don’t have that luxury.

Leaders must set the world on a trajectory to limit global warming below 2 degrees Centigrade.

There is no more time for business as usual.

The more we delay, the more we will have to pay.

We need to cut emissions and work towards carbon neutrality.
The United Nations has made a firm commitment that we will make all the United Nations systems carbon [neutral] by 2020.
This is what we have decided just a couple of weeks ago.

We need to invest more money in tomorrow’s green economy.

We need to put a price on carbon and pollution.

And we need to strengthen resilience to the changes to come.

That means getting all hands on deck.

Again, I thank you very much for your strong commitment.
Now, my regret is that I may have to run without being able to answer your questions, because I have to conclude this [Climate Change] Summit meeting.
I cannot make all the leaders wait.
But I have the Assistant Secretary-General who is the head of Climate Change research policy – chief policy advisor for the United Nations - Bob Orr.
He will be happy to answer your questions.
I hope you will understand.
Thank you very much.
"
"8","G20-2015","

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,

I thank Turkey for hosting this important meeting of the G20.

Let me start by reiterating my profound condolences to the people of France following the barbaric terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday night.
My thoughts are with the families of the victims at this time of grief and loss.

Terrorists continue to commit atrocious acts across the world.
Their inhumanity is clear; their ideologies are bankrupt.
No grievance or cause can justify such violence.
Those who claim to be acting in the name of religion are only harming their religion.

Terrorism is a threat to all humankind.
As we have seen over the years with grim regularity, no country, and no city, nobody is immune.
In the past four days alone, horrendous terrorist bombings have also killed dozens of people in Beirut and Baghdad.

It is heartbreaking to see so many families, communities and societies hardened or left in ruins.
It is tragic to see so many people – largely young men -- so radicalized that they are willing to lose their lives in spasms of meaningless violence.

We will be discussing terrorism at this Summit.

I will stress to world leaders that our response needs to be robust, but always within the rule of law and with respect for human rights.
Otherwise, we will only fan the fire we are trying to put out.

We also need to address the underlying drivers of violent extremism.
I will soon present to the Member States of the United Nations a comprehensive Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism.

At this time of heightened tensions, I caution against actions that would only perpetuate the cycle of hatred and violence.
I again offer condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims and to all the people of France.

This Summit takes place as we approach the end of what has been a watershed year for international cooperation.

Governments have agreed a new and visionary sustainable development agenda with 17 Sustainable Development Goals to the year 2030.
These goals can set the direction for a prosperous, inclusive and environmentally sustainable world.
They should be a priority at this Summit.

Governments will soon meet in Paris to finalize a global climate change agreement.
One hundred and sixty-one countries representing more than 90 per cent of global emissions have now submitted their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions or INDC.
These plans will bend the emissions curve downward, and move us in the right direction.

But they will not keep us under the dangerous 2-degree Celsius threshold.
We have to go much further and faster.

I see four essential elements for success in Paris.

First, durability.
Paris must send a clear signal to markets that the low-carbon transformation of the global economy is inevitable and beneficial.

Second, flexibility.
The agreement must be able to accommodate changes in the global economy while striking balance between the leadership role of developed countries and the increasing responsibilities of developing countries.

Third, solidarity.
An agreement must provide financing and technology transfer for developing countries.
Developed countries must keep their pledge to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 for both adaptation and mitigation.

And fourth, credibility.
An agreement must establish strong monitoring mechanisms, be able to respond to rapidly escalating climate impacts, and ensure that we are on a path to a low carbon economy, as science demands.

With two weeks left before the start of COP-21, it is urgent that all leaders work to find compromises.

I also count on G20 leaders for support as we address the biggest crisis of forced displacement since the Second World War.

This is not only a crisis of numbers; it is a crisis of global solidarity.

I pay tribute to Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon for hosting 4 million Syrian refugees.

We must ensure enhanced support to these and other countries accommodating the greatest numbers of refugees -- without at the same time cutting back on official development assistance.

I strongly appeal to European nations coping with mass forced displacement not to reduce development assistance to finance the cost of refugee flows.
Helping people in need should not be a zero sum game.

I urge G20 leaders to heed the growing global call for a recovery plan for the region – perhaps akin to the Marshall Plan in scale.

We should also work together towards a much-needed global compact for human mobility.

I will soon present to the General Assembly further thoughts on this matter.

And of course, reaching a political settlement in Syria should be a top priority.
I welcome the renewed sense of urgency that the International Syria Support Group is bringing to these efforts, and I commend the leadership of U.S.
Secretary of State Kerry, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and others involved in the talks yesterday in Vienna.
I urge the participants to move beyond their differences so that they can push further for a nationwide ceasefire, combat terrorism and address key governance and constitutional issues.
After years of division, this is a rare moment of diplomatic opportunity to end the violence and advance the search for a negotiated political solution.

Thank you."
"9","G20-2016","

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the media,

I am very pleased to participate in this G20 Summit meeting in Hangzhou and this morning, I would like to share some thoughts of mine, and the United Nations concerns, which may be your concerns, international concerns.

This is my eleventh G20 Summit as Secretary-General of the United Nations.
As you may know, this is one of the few last months for me as Secretary-General of the United Nations.
My mandate ends 31 December, so this is will be my last G20 Summit meeting.

Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to begin by congratulating President Xi Jinping and Chinese people and Government for successfully hosting and wonderfully organizing this G20 Summit meeting and I welcome the Summit’s focus on the Sustainable Development Goals – our new framework to advance peace and prosperity for all of us and for a healthy planet.

I continue to urge all countries to align their national policies, socio-economic policies, programmes and investment behind these Sustainable Development Goals.&ampnbsp

This Summit has also witnessed major steps forward on climate change.&ampnbsp

As you have already covered, yesterday, the leaders of China and the United States officially joined the Paris Agreement on climate change by depositing their legal documents with me yesterday.

I was very honoured to receive those legal instruments from the two leaders in person and highly commend the outstanding leadership demonstrated by President Xi Jinping of China and President Barack Obama of the United States.

With China and the United States making this historic step we now have 26 parties to the UNFCCC Convention and 39% of global greenhouse emissions accounted for.

Now we just need another 29 Parties and 16 per cent more of global emissions to bring this Paris Agreement into force.
And I really count on your strong support from the media.

I urge all leaders, particularly, including the leaders from G20 countries, to show their leadership by accelerating their domestic ratification processes so we can turn the aspirations of Paris into the transformative climate action the world so urgently needs.

To that end, as it is already known I am convening a High-Level event at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, on the margins of the General Assembly, on 21 September in the morning.

I am happy to hear that the draft communiqué of this G20 Summit is also encouraging the speedy entry into force of this key international agreement and I would like to [urge] G20 members, once again, to lead by example on this defining issue of climate change.

Legal processes must be concluded in parallel with a renewed commitment by all the countries to honour their pledges, particularly the OECD Member States, in terms of financial and technical support, including through the Green Climate Fund to many vulnerable countries, developing countries so that they can adjust to this situation, this climate change.
We need to keep this momentum.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Before I arrived in China, I visited Myanmar and Sri Lanka, two countries undergoing historic transformation.

In Myanmar, I was encouraged to participate in the Twenty-first Century Panglong Conference in Myanmar, a critical juncture in the seventy-year history of conflict and division between the Union Government and armed ethnic groups.
The success of this peace process is in the vital interest of all the people of Myanmar, regardless of ethnicity, religion, political affiliation or socio-economic status.

In Sri Lanka, I stressed that ongoing efforts in peacebuilding, reconciliation and post-conflict transformation, including transitional justice, provide an opportunity for this country to emerge from this trauma stronger.
I underlined the importance of addressing the concerns and the aspirations of Sri Lankan people, particularly those victims and their families, in a credible manner.

Sustainable development requires sustainable peace: for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to succeed, for a steady economic growth to be achieved, we need peace and development to work hand in hand.
The United Nations will continue to support nations in transition, as they strive to ensure peace, development and human rights.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Here in Hangzhou, I will engage G20 leaders across the breadth of the Summit’s agenda.

I will also emphasize that, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, it is crucial that we work together to resolve urgent challenges posed by poverty, inequality and conflicts.

We are witnessing protracted conflicts sadly in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan, Libya, Mali and many other places.
Extreme poverty and deepening inequalities challenge our sense of what is just.
The number of people displaced by conflict reached the highest number since the end of the Second World War, they have reached 65 million, and is now increasing day by day because of continuing conflicts here and there.
These issues should be resolved by international solidarity.

At this time of great turbulence, I commend the inclusive and participatory approach of the G20 Chinese Presidency, which has involved more non-G20 [countries] than ever before in the history of the G20.

The G20 this year is going through a great transformation, moving from a short-term focus on managing global financial challenges to a long-term vision for sustainable development.

In that regard, I thank His Excellency President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Presidency for emphasizing sustainable development efforts as a core element of the G20 agenda.

The G20 Action Plan on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is one of the key outcomes of this meeting in Hangzhou.

G20 countries have a key role in promoting stable, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, implementing the sustainable development agenda and supporting the implementation of the Paris Agreement.

I thank you for your attention.

Xie xie, thank you.

"10","G20-2018","

Good afternoon.

 
I am here to announce that I will be leaving later today to attend two important meetings on two of the most pressing challenges of our times: advancing a fair globalization and accelerating climate action.
 
Tonight, I depart for the G20 Summit in Argentina, where I will stress the need for inclusive development that leaves no one behind – the core promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
 
From there, I will attend the Climate Conference in Poland – the so-called COP24.
 
These meetings come at a crucial moment.
 
Our world is obviously facing a crisis of confidence.
 
Those left behind by globalization are losing trust in governments and institutions.

 
Inequality is pervasive and increasing, especially within nations.

 
Trade disputes are escalating.
 
And an undercurrent of geopolitical tensions is adding further pressure to the global economy.

 
It is imperative that we address the root causes and work together to promote a fair globalization.

 
The Sustainable Development Goals are the blueprint for that fair globalization.

 
I hope leaders at the G20 will give it a strong push forward.
 
But let’s not forget that equity is not just a matter for this generation.
 We must think of generations to come.

 
At the moment, we are headed for a world of cataclysm and uncertainty due to climate disruption.

 
The world’s top scientists have warned that we have little time left to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees until the end of the century.
 
A UN Environment report just yesterday underlined that ambition must increase five-fold to stay within that limit.

 
And the World Meteorological Organization found that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased to levels not seen in 3 million years.
 
Some may argue that you cannot fight climate change and have a good economy.
 I strongly disagree.
 In fact, the opposite is true.

 
The social, economic and environmental costs of climate change dwarf the costs of acting now.

 
Failure to act means more disasters and emergencies and air pollution that could cost the global economy as much as US$21 trillion by 2050.

 
On the other hand, ambitious climate action will not only slow temperature rise, it will be good for economies, for the environment and for public health.

 
According to the World Health Organization, more than 90 per cent of the world’s urban population breathes unsafe air.
 
Meeting the Paris Agreement commitments could save more than a million lives a year.
 
Climate solutions represent opportunity, and technology is on our side.
 They are wise investments in an equitable, prosperous and sustainable future.
 Green business truly is good business.
 
Now, the members of the G20 are responsible for more than three-quarters of greenhouse emissions.
 
Yet it is equally true that G20 members have the power to bend the emissions curve.
"
"11","G20-2019","Good morning, this G20 meeting takes place in a moment of high tension, high political tension.
We have global warming, but we have also global political warming, and this can be seen in relation to trade and technology conflicts, it can be seen in relation to situations in several parts of the world, namely the Gulf.
 
And it is also a moment in which there are uncertainties about the global economy – uncertainties due to trade conflicts, but also uncertainties related to high levels of debt, to potential instability in financial markets, the risk of slowdown in global growth, and obviously, in a situation like this, even if I pay tribute to the very committed engagements of the Government of Japan and the Prime Minister of Japan for meaningful conclusions of this summit, it is clear that it will be very difficult to have a breakthrough in relation to some of the most difficult challenges that the international community is facing.
But, of course, the UN is not part of the G20, we are not members of the G20, but I am grateful for this opportunity to address the leaders and to convey to them our concerns.
 
And I will today, essentially mention two: first, climate change, second, the implementation of the Agenda 2030.
And in both, we are lagging behind.
 
Climate change is running faster than what we are.
We are seeing heat waves in Europe, drought in Africa, storms happening also in Africa and the Caribbean, even the United States.
We are seeing a multiplication of natural disasters that are becoming more intense, more dramatic, with worsening humanitarian consequences and more frequent.
And we are seeing glaciers melting, corals bleaching, the Arctic with the lowest levels ever in relation to the parts covered by ice.
We see the melting in Greenland and Antarctica, it’s extremely worrying.
 
And so all the analyses that can be made show the situation, in practical terms, is worse than what we could have forecasted and the political will has been failing.
This is a paradox that needs to be addressed.
 
Now, I believe in science.
I believe in what has been considered by the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] report, the most valid scientific position today, which is that we need to make sure that we do not reach more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming at the end of the century.
And for that, we need to be carbon neutral in 2050 and we need to have a much more ambitious expression by governments and other actors of their commitments when the Nationally Determined Contributions will be reviewed in 2020.
And that is reason why I'm convening a climate summit in New York in September, and that is the reason why I will be appealing to the leaders here in relation to a much stronger commitment of their countries for climate action, and there are many aspects of that that are absolutely essential on this: putting a price on carbon, ending subsidies to fossil fuels, not accepting the idea that we still have an acceleration of the construction of coal power plants, and many other aspects of that that are extremely relevant in order to make sure that we are able to abide by what the scientific community is telling us is absolutely essential to rescue the planet.
 
And then in relation to the Agenda 2030, it is clear that we are lagging behind.
If we project the different Sustainable Development Goals, the evolution since the beginning until now to 2030, we will be more or less at midway of what the international community has determined when the Agenda 2030 was approved, which means that we need to accelerate, accelerate the mobilization of resources, natural resources, countries need to do more, mobilizing their own internal resources, improving their governance, reducing corruption, implementing the rule of law.
 
At the same time, we need to do more in mobilizing the private sector.
Without the private sector, it would be impossible to achieve these Goals.
And a lot needs to be done in order to raise awareness and to show the opportunities that exist and to create mechanism to reduce risks.
 
At the same time, we need to do more to enhance international solidarity, because indeed, we are lagging behind and we need to accelerate.
And this will be again, one of the objectives of the summit that we will convene in September, together with the climate summit, both about the Sustainable Development Goals and about the aspects related to the high-level political forum of Member States, and about the financing for development.
 
And so an appeal, an appeal for a much stronger commitment of the members of the G20 that represent 80 per cent of the emissions in climate change and that represent a very important area of international financial and economic cooperation, and an appeal for a much stronger engagement for an enhanced commitment in order to be able to avoid the present situation in which climate change is running faster than what we are and we are lagging behind in the implementation of the Agenda 2030."
"12","G20-2011-nicolas-sarkozy","Hello ladies and gentlemen.

In two days of very intense discussions in an atmosphere dominated both by the gravity of the situation and the international community’s need for unity, we’ve worked on both short-term challenges to reduce the impact of the crises and, in the long term, putting the global economy back on the path of growth.

I’d like to share with you, in a few words, the three messages of the summit.

Greece/Euro Area/IMF

The first one concerns Europe, which has made every effort to provide a credible response to the crisis. It was essential for Europe to arrive at the G20 united. We also have the unanimous support of our partners, and it seems to me we’ve made progress on three essential points in the implementation of the 27 October agreement.

The first point is Europe’s firm stance towards Greece, which led to a crucial collective realization of the challenges for that great country’s future. The conditions are currently being created for consensus in Greece on the 26 October agreement, and we’re really delighted that the atmosphere in Greece today bears no resemblance at the end of this week to what it was at the beginning of last week.

Secondly on the European crisis, I’d like to pay tribute to the effort of Italy, who has taken the necessary measures to restore confidence, balance the budget as early as 2013 and strengthen her growth. Italy is a key Euro Area country, one of the world’s largest economies, and I want to welcome Italy’s decision to call upon the European Commission and IMF to certify the results obtained, on a quarterly basis, with the results being published and these assessments of course being made public.

Finally, we made a commitment to increase the IMF’s resources if it was felt necessary. And we established the conditions for achieving this goal. The IMF must fulfil its role as a firewall against systemic risk; at their next meeting in February the finance ministers have been instructed to deploy several options to achieve an increase in those resources: the allocation of SDRs, bilateral loans to the IMF and specific accounts at the IMF. We didn’t decide between these different methods, but the approach is indeed to boost the IMF’s resources.

Growth/social protection

The G20’s second message: we decided to use all the room for manoeuvre to support growth. The situation is in fact much more complex than in 2009; there’s no single response. Washington and London were “recovery by every means”. Toronto was “reduction measures of all kinds”. Cannes has distinguished between the countries’ different situations, and the final communiqué says those countries with solid budgetary situations – I’m thinking of China and Germany – will activate the automatic stabilizers and are ready to take new measures to support growth. So we’ve got away from the status quo in Seoul, which gave rise – as you doubtless remember – to differences between the countries on this issue. Moreover, those countries which have large foreign trade surpluses are pledging to increase domestic demand and speed up the flexibility of their exchange regimes in order to reduce currency reserve accumulation in the medium term. You can see very clearly the great country that has made these commitments, and that’s excellent news.

Finally – and it’s a great novelty – the Action Plan for Growth and Jobs fully takes into account the social dimension of globalization. It’s the first time the G20 countries, and particularly the emerging countries, have expressed their determination to establish social protection floors. Furthermore, there’s a commitment from the whole G20 to saying that social protection, the social model, the level of protection favours growth and doesn’t run counter to growth. I think it’s the first time an international summit has so clearly signalled, as a goal, that a high level of social protection favours growth.

Financial regulation/tax havens/Financial Stability Board

Final point: big steps forward, it seems to me, on the French presidency’s priorities on financial regulation. We decided to publish, or rather the Financial Stability Board will today publish a list of the 29 large, international systemic banks, and we decided that they’ll be subject to obligations with regard to transparency and enhanced regulation. Second point: the Global Forum’s publication of 11 countries we regard as tax havens: Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Botswana, Brunei, Panama, the Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay and Vanuatu don’t have legal frameworks adapted to the exchange of tax information. We don’t want any more tax havens. The message is very clear. We don’t want any more of them. And those countries which continue to be tax havens, through opacity in banking, will be deemed pariahs in the international community. Things have made a lot of progress; they must make further progress. Let me add that Switzerland and Liechtenstein didn’t qualify in phase two until they put right certain failings that have been identified. The credibility of all the commitments against tax havens lies in the systematic publication, at each of our summits, of a list of those countries that won’t do what is needed to get away from unacceptable behaviour. We decided not to tolerate that. I’d like to ask you to remember that three years ago in London I had to threaten to leave the room [unless they published] a list of non-cooperative jurisdictions, because at the time people wouldn’t even utter the phrase “tax haven”. So you can see how much progress has been made.

Finally, we decided to reform the FSB to make it a real global finance organization. Legal personality, financial autonomy, the ability to reach agreements with other organizations, and opening up its steering committee to the treasuries of the large financial centres to ensure the G20’s decisions are implemented.

Capital control/Special Drawing Rights/IMF surveillance

On the international monetary system, it’s a long-term project; when France put it on the agenda it sparked a whole load of sceptical comments. Today everyone believes it’s the project of the coming years. So we set a framework for managing capital flows; using capital control – and this is very important – is now accepted as a stabilization measure. There was a mistake that consisted in seeing, drawing a parallel between free trade and the free movement of capital; capital control may prove necessary and is recognized as a stabilization measure.

There’s also the review of the SDR basket in 2015, which will be able to take in new currencies. The yuan is a clear candidate, given China’s commitment – which I noted with satisfaction – to gradual convertibility.

The reform of the IMF’s surveillance to broaden it out to new areas: exchange rates, capital flows, the contagion effect: we’re making big changes to the IMF’s missions. Finally, new IMF facilities: a short-term liquidity line to tackle systemic shocks.

Agriculture/development/innovative financing/financial transaction tax

On agriculture, it’s the first time agriculture has been on the G20’s agenda. It really was a question we didn’t talk about. An increase in production is essential in order to feed the world’s population. Transparency on agricultural markets. We secured the regulation of commodity derivatives markets. There’s an agreement to regulate those markets and players in those markets in order to combat market abuses and above all give regulators the power to set position limits, to prevent a single player from being able to manipulate rates, through disproportionate purchases or sales. When Bruno Le Maire, François Baroin and I began, we didn’t think we’d be able to achieve such a result at a summit of this kind. Finally, emergency community stocks and a ban on export restrictions for purchases by food programmes.

As regards development: innovative financing and infrastructure. Innovative financing features in the final communiqué, with explicit reference to the financial transaction tax. A number of countries want to get innovative financing removed and the reference to the financial transaction tax removed from the communiqué; they’re still in there.

What stage are we at on this? There are now a number of countries which have joined France’s battle. Let me remind you that when France began this battle she was absolutely alone. Today, besides France, the European Commission, Germany, Spain, Argentina, the African Union, Ethiopia, South Africa, the United Nations Secretary-General – and Brazil, who has told us of her interest in the demarche – are in favour of the principle of a financial transaction tax. The text of the declaration states that the G20 acknowledges the initiatives in certain member countries to tax the financial sector for various purposes, including a financial transaction tax to support development. You can’t imagine what a battle such a tax represents.

Let me be very clear: France believes that, in order to be meet the development challenges, there has to be innovative financing, given the deficit in every country. And we said in the communiqué that, in Bill Gates’ report, there are a number of innovative financing mechanisms and that every country pledges at least to adopt one of these.

Second point: from a moral point of view we believe it’s absolutely essential for people throughout the world to know that the financial players who led the world into the mistakes we’re aware of will be made to contribute financially to repairing the damage. That’s the purpose of the financial transaction tax.

So, the European Commission project – which is the only concrete project on the table and which shows the technical possibility of a financial transaction tax – will be discussed by the Council of Ministers and heads of state and government at the beginning of next year. France will fight for this tax to become a reality, and she believes that waiting for the rest of the world to adopt such a tax isn’t a good enough argument for refusing to implement it. Clearly, to get this result we’re going to do everything to draw on public opinion in every country.

I might add that I was pleased that Barack Obama was receptive to the principle of the financial sector helping resolve the crisis. This doesn’t go as far as a financial transaction tax, but he was receptive to the idea of financial players making a financial contribution to find a way out of the crisis.

Let me remind you that we started from a situation of absolute deadlock and that the financial transaction tax is now up for debate, and I hope it will actually be implemented in 2012.

There are still a lot of things to resolve, particularly on allocating the product of the future tax, but it’s very interesting because when you discuss allocating the product of the future tax it’s because you believe the principle of the tax has made so much progress that it’s appropriate to discuss allocating the product of it.

France believes a large share, yet to be defined – a majority of the total – should go to development.

Finally, we had a debate on global governance, with a very good report by David Cameron.

There you are, ladies and gentlemen; I apologize for no doubt talking for too long. I’ll now take your questions."
